# How to use

### Note: Always start the server first and the client to avoid a few unwanted errors

### Running the server

- On the terminal, use `npm start` while active on the server directory
- The server by default runs on port 5000, but can be changed depending on what environment it runs on
- The server, upon starting successfully will display a message on the terminal saying `Server running on port <PORT>`, where <PORT> is replaced by the port number on which it listens

### Running the client

- On the terminal, use `npm start` while active on the client directory
- The client by default runs on port 3000, but can be changed depending on what environment it runs on
- The client upon starting successfully will open the app on the default browser (in this case Google Chrome)
